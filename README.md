# cheese-man-cms
take a look at the illustrous and elusive innnerworks of Cheese man Incoporated

# Description

Welcome to Cheese Man Incorporated where we make the big cheese.  YOU have been hired to keep things on the up and up on the digital side.  Make sure every person is on the payroll and all that.  Poor Jefferson was eating cheddar out of the breakroom for months after the last mixup.  This here CMS will give you everything you need to maintain and update our database.  May your cheese always be sharp!!

On a more serious note, this project is a way to pratice MYSQL database pratices and how to safely and asynchonously access a database and update and insert into it.  Asynchronous is still hard though but since databases are the cornerstone of most businesses, it is still worth learning.  Figuring out how to select, insert, and update through a javascript backend is fulfulling especially as table.console gives a clean ui to show off the tables.  I still don't get how to pass classes or objects to other function in other files but that is something I will learn some other time.
